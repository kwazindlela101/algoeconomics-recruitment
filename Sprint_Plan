RISK MANAGEMENT
Aggressive timelines require proactive risk management. Here are common risks and mitigation strategies:
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Developer drops out mid-sprint	Critical features undelivered, timeline at risk	Pair programming from Week 1. Cross-train on workstreams. Keep 1-2 strong backup candidates warm.
External API unreliable	Data collection fails, corruption scores can't be calculated	Implement retry logic and fallbacks. Cache aggressively. Have manual data entry process as backup.
Scope creep	Team gets distracted by nice-to-have features, MVP deadline missed	Ruthless prioritization. 'Post-funding' backlog for non-critical features. CEO reviews weekly progress.
Technical debt accumulation	Code becomes unmaintainable, slows future development post-funding	Mandatory code reviews. Automated linting. Document as you go. Allocate 20% time to refactoring.
Academic exam period	Developers unavailable for 1-2 weeks, timeline slips	Front-load critical work. Build in 1-week buffer. Adjust expectations if unavoidable conflicts arise.
 
DEFINITION OF DONE
A feature is only considered 'done' when ALL of the following criteria are met:
1.	Code Complete: Feature implemented according to specification
2.	Tested: Unit tests written, integration tests pass, manual testing complete
3.	Code Reviewed: At least one other developer has reviewed and approved
4.	Documented: API docs updated, inline comments added, README updated if needed
5.	Merged: Pull request merged to main branch
6.	Deployed: Changes deployed to staging environment and smoke tested
7.	Demoed: Feature demonstrated to CEO in Friday review
No shortcuts. If it's not done according to these criteria, it's not done.
 
CELEBRATION & RECOGNITION
This is a marathon disguised as a sprint. Celebrating progress keeps morale high and momentum strong.
Weekly Wins:
•	Every Friday call starts with celebrating the week's achievements
•	Public recognition in Slack for major milestones
•	Screenshot and share progress (e.g., "First API call returned data!")
Milestone Celebrations:
•	End of Week 2: First automated data collection working
•	End of Week 3: First corruption score calculated
•	End of Week 5: MVP shipped to production. Team dinner (on AlgoEconomics)
Post-Sprint Recognition:
After the February 6 completion:
•	Personalized thank you letters from CEO
•	LinkedIn recommendations highlighting specific contributions
•	First consideration for equity and full-time roles post-funding
•	Recognition on AlgoEconomics website as founding technical team
 
FINAL THOUGHTS
This 30-day sprint is not just about building an MVP. It's about proving that AlgoEconomics can execute. It's about demonstrating to Series Seed investors that the Google search result wasn't aspirational - it was prophetic.
You're not just volunteer developers. You're the founding technical team of a company that's creating a new category: AI-powered governance risk infrastructure for UK-Africa capital allocation.
The timeline is aggressive. The expectations are high. The reward - if we execute - is being part of something that changes how billions of dollars flow into African markets.
Let's build.
January 6 - February 6, 2026
30 days to change everything.
