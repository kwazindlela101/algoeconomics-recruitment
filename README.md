## 🌍 Mission

AlgoEconomics provides institutional investors with data-driven, real-time economic intelligence for UK-Africa capital allocation. We are building infrastructure-grade governance risk analysis powered by artificial intelligence.

## 🎯 What We Build

### The AI Corruption Index
A proprietary governance risk scoring system that provides institutional investors and businesses with real-time, AI-driven analysis of governance performance risks in African markets. Unlike traditional ratings that rely on lagging surveys, our index uses artificial intelligence to proactively identify and mitigate risks.

Our MVP uses free, high-quality governance data from global institutions including the World Bank, IMF, AfDB, UN ECFA, and national statistics offices. These sources are validated, auditable, and aligned with our scoring methodology.

**Core Components:**
- **Procurement Transparency Scores** - Analysis of public tender integrity
- **Regulatory Risk Mapping** - Identification of jurisdictional vulnerabilities  
- **Institutional Quality Metrics** - Assessment of legal framework robustness
- **Sector-Specific Analysis** - Tailored risk profiles across seven key sectors

### Platform Features
- **Real-Time Economic Indicators** - Automated data collection from World Bank, IMF, central bank APIs
- **Sector Intelligence** - Mining, Agriculture, Fintech, Energy, Aviation, Healthcare, Tourism
- **Expert Commentary** - Flagship voices including WEF Head of Africa, leading economists
- **Historical Analysis** - Time-series comparison and trend identification

## 🚀 Market Validation

Before building a single line of code, AlgoEconomics achieved unprecedented organic market validation: **Google's AI Overview now recognizes and describes our proprietary AI Corruption Index** as an established governance risk scoring system.

This validates both the market need and our category-creation positioning.
