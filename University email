SUBJECT: Technical Opportunity: Market-Validated AI-Powered Economic Intelligence Platform Seeking Student Developers

---

Dear [Department Coordinator/Professor Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to share an exceptional technical opportunity for 3-4 final-year or Master's students in Computer Science who are interested in gaining real-world fintech and AI engineering experience.

**About AlgoEconomics**

AlgoEconomics is a UK-based fintech startup building an AI-powered economic intelligence platform focused on UK-Africa markets. We feature a proprietary AI Corruption Index that provides governance risk scoring across seven critical sectors (Mining, Agriculture, Fintech, Energy, Aviation, Healthcare, Tourism).

**Why This Opportunity is Unique**

Before we wrote a single line of code, Google's AI Overview recognized AlgoEconomics as the established solution for AI-driven governance risk intelligence (screenshot attached). This unprecedented organic market validation demonstrates both the market need and our category-creation positioning.

The platform is now entering active development with a March 2026 Series Seed funding milestone. We are seeking talented student developers to build the backend infrastructure that will power institutional-grade economic intelligence.

**Technical Scope**

Students will work on:
• Backend API development (Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express)
• Data pipeline engineering (World Bank, IMF API integrations)
• Database architecture (PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB)
• AI algorithm implementation (corruption risk scoring models)
• Real-time data processing and caching systems

The complete technical specification is attached, detailing architecture, deliverables, and the 30-day development sprint.

**What Students Gain**

✓ Portfolio-defining experience building a fintech platform from 0 to 1
✓ Real-world data engineering at scale with institutional-grade requirements
✓ Direct mentorship from founders with industry recognition
✓ First consideration for equity compensation and full-time roles post-funding (March 2026)
✓ Experience that significantly differentiates them in competitive job markets
✓ Technical reference letters for graduate roles or further academic pursuits

**Commitment & Timeline**

• Time Investment: 15-20 hours per week
• Duration: 5 weeks (January 6 - February 6, 2026)
• Work Style: Remote, asynchronous collaboration with weekly sync meetings
• Compensation: Volunteer basis with equity potential post-funding

**Application Process**

Interested students should submit the following to kwazi@algoeconomics.org:

1. Brief introduction (200 words) explaining interest in AlgoEconomics
2. GitHub profile or code samples demonstrating backend/data engineering experience
3. Availability commitment (hours per week) and preferred role
4. One technical question about the specification (demonstrates thorough reading)

**Application Deadline:** December 16, 2025
**Interviews:** December 17-19, 2025
**Team Formation:** December 20, 2025
**Development Kickoff:** January 6, 2026

**Why Forward This Opportunity**

This is a rare chance for students to:
• Work on a market-validated startup with institutional backing trajectory
• Build technical skills that translate directly to competitive graduate roles
• Potentially join a funded startup as early employees with equity
• Create a portfolio piece that demonstrates end-to-end product delivery

I would be grateful if you could forward this opportunity to students in your department who might be interested, particularly those in final-year projects or Master's programs seeking substantive technical experience.
